;  Generate an UUID
Do OWEB.$makeuuid(kFalse) Returns lUUID
Quit method lUUID

;  We use the UUID in the headers of the code request in order to identify
;  the instance which made the request when the API endpoints redirects
;  the user back to our URI.

;  The reason we do this is to add an asynchronous nature
;  to this application.
